Your Entry class still doesn't have any methods. You did add methods to the Journal class. You should probably pass in a parameter for save() and load() though so you can specify the file name. If a method takes input parameters, you should put them in the parentheses. You should also include return types for your methods to show what they return. Your methods should also be in PascalCase. For example: Save(fileName: string): void
